// ding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. 
// If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point,
//  just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file.
//  Then write one sentence describing what the program does.



// Sure, I'll choose the "Favorite Number" and "Number Eight" programs for adding comments. 
// Comments are a great way to document your code,
//  making it easier to understand for others and for yourself when you come back to it later.
