// Certainly! Here's how you can store the names of a few friends in an array called names in TypeScript,
// and then print each person's name by accessing each element in the array, 
// one at a time:
// This code snippet uses a for...of loop to iterate over each element in the names array. For each iteration,
//  the variable name holds the current element from the array, 
// and then it's printed to the console with console.log(name);.
// Store the names of a few friends in an array called names
var names = ["ANUM", "SAMA", "UROOJ", "SHUMAILA"];
// Print each person's name by accessing each element in the array, one at a time
for (var _i = 0, names_1 = names; _i < names_1.length; _i++) {
    var name_1 = names_1[_i];
    console.log(name_1);
}
