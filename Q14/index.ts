//Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, 
// who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. 
// Then use your list to print a message to each person, 
// inviting them to dinner.


// Define an array of guests

// Loop through the guests array and print an invitation message for each
for (const guest of guests) {
