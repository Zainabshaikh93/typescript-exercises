//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object.
//  The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name.
//   It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. 
//   Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, 
//   such as a color or an optional feature.
//  Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
